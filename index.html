        <h2>Who is Henry Ford?</h2>
        <p>
          Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 â€“ April 7, 1947) was an American
          industrialist and business magnate. As the founder of the Ford Motor
          Company, he is credited as a pioneer in making automobiles affordable
          for middle-class Americans through the system that came to be known as
          Fordism. In 1911 he was awarded a patent for the transmission
          mechanism that would be used in the Ford Model T and other
          automobiles.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Ford was born in a farmhouse in Springwells Township, Michigan, and
          left home at the age of 16 to find work in Detroit. It was a few years
          before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and
          throughout the later half of the 1880s, he began repairing and later
          constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of
          Edison Electric. He founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903 after prior
          failures in business, but success in constructing automobiles.

          <p>Ford said two significant events occurred in 1875 when he was 12: he received the watch, and he witnessed the operation of a Nichols and Shepard road engine, "...the first vehicle other than horse-drawn that I had ever seen".</p>

          As the sole owner of the Ford Motor Company, Ford became one of the
          wealthiest persons in the world. He was also among the pioneers of the
          five-day work-week. Ford believed that consumerism could help to bring
          about world peace. His commitment to systematically lowering costs
          resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a
          franchise system, which allowed for car dealerships throughout North
          America and in major cities on six continents.

        <h2>Personal Life and Death</h2>
        <p>
          Ford was known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I,
          although during the war his company became a major supplier of
          weapons. He promoted the League of Nations. In the 1920s Ford promoted
          antisemitism through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent and the
          book The International Jew. He opposed his country's entry into World
          War II, and served for a time on board of the America First Committee.
          After his son Edsel died in 1943 Ford resumed control of the company,
          but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control
          of several of his subordinates. He turned over the company to his
          grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. Upon his death in 1947 he left most of
          his wealth to the Ford Foundation, and control of the company to his
          family.
